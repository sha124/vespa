Other experts, e.g. for interfaces, BI, permissions or forms, can be brought in as needed. The small core team is able to work with low resource requirements and efficient pathways. The result is top-quality projects in a short timeframe. Opportunity for further business optimization We also have competence in the fields of Managed Services, Analytics and HR, and can weave these themes into your project in the form of IT architecture, BI strategy, digitalizing HR systems, etc. Another choice many customers make is to take this opportunity to outsource operation and maintenance of their new SAP S/4HANA system in our S/4-certified data center.'}},\n",
